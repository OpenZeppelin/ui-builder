## Architecture

The application uses a modular, domain-driven adapter pattern to support multiple blockchain ecosystems. For a detailed explanation of the adapter architecture and module responsibilities, please see the **[Adapter Architecture Guide](./docs/ADAPTER_ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

**Key Components:**

- **Builder**: Chain-agnostic application logic, UI components, and the export system. It includes:
  - The `ecosystemManager.ts` for discovering network configurations and adapter capabilities.
  - **Modular State Management**: Decomposed hook architecture with specialized responsibilities.
  - **Application Sidebar**: Complete UI for managing saved configurations with import/export capabilities

- **Storage System (`packages/storage`)**: IndexedDB-based persistence layer built on Dexie.js providing:
  - **Auto-Save Engine**: Debounced saving with in-memory caching and global coordination
  - **Multi-Tab Synchronization**: Real-time updates across browser tabs
  - **Import/Export**: JSON-based configuration sharing with validation
  - **CRUD Operations**: Complete lifecycle management for contract UI configurations
  - **Performance Optimization**: Efficient handling of 1000+ records with reactive updates

- **Adapters (`packages/adapter-*`)**: Individual packages containing chain-specific implementations (e.g., `EvmAdapter`, `SolanaAdapter`). Each adapter conforms to the common `ContractAdapter` interface defined in `packages/types`. Adapters are instantiated with a specific `NetworkConfig`, making them network-aware. The `builder` package (via providers from `@openzeppelin/ui-builder-react-core`) dynamically loads and uses these adapters. Furthermore, adapters can optionally provide UI-specific functionalities:
  - **React UI Context Provider** (e.g., for `wagmi/react` on EVM): `WalletStateProvider` (from `@openzeppelin/ui-builder-react-core`) consumes this to set up the necessary app-wide context for the active adapter.
  - **Facade Hooks** (e.g., `useAccount`, `useSwitchChain`): These are exposed by `WalletStateProvider` (via `useWalletState().walletFacadeHooks` from `@openzeppelin/ui-builder-react-core`) for UI components to interact with wallet functionalities reactively and agnostically.
  - **Standardized UI Components** (e.g., `ConnectButton`): These components are retrieved via `activeAdapter.getEcosystemWalletComponents()` and are expected to internally use the facade hooks.

- **Renderer**: Shared library containing app rendering components and common utilities (like logging).

- **React Core (`packages/react-core`)**: Centralized React state management providing:
  - **Adapter Provider**: Singleton pattern for adapter instance management
  - **Wallet State Provider**: Global wallet/network state coordination
  - **Context Hooks**: `useWalletState()` and `useAdapterContext()` for consistent state access

- **UI Components (`packages/ui`)**: Comprehensive component library including:
  - **Basic Primitives**: Buttons, inputs, cards, dialogs following shadcn/ui patterns
  - **Form Fields**: Specialized components for React Hook Form integration
  - **Field Utilities**: Validation, accessibility, and layout helpers

- **Types**: Shared TypeScript type definitions across all packages, including the crucial `ContractAdapter` interface and types for adapter UI enhancements.

- **Styling System**: Centralized CSS variables and styling approach used across all packages.

This architecture allows for easy extension to support additional blockchain ecosystems without modifying the builder application logic. The `builder` package dynamically loads and uses adapters via `ecosystemManager.ts` and the provider model (from `@openzeppelin/ui-builder-react-core`) and the export system includes the specific adapter package needed for the target chain in exported forms. It utilizes **custom Vite plugins** to create **virtual modules**, enabling reliable loading of shared assets (like configuration files between packages) across package boundaries, ensuring consistency between development, testing, and exported builds.

## Project Constitution

This project is governed by the UI Builder Constitution. Please read it before contributing changes that affect architecture, adapters, or tooling:

- [./.specify/memory/constitution.md](./.specify/memory/constitution.md)

## Build System

The project uses a standardized `tsup`-based build system for all library packages, ensuring proper ES module output with correct import extensions:

- **tsup**: All library packages are built using `tsup` to generate both ES modules (`.js`) and CommonJS (`.cjs`) formats.
- **TypeScript**: The TypeScript compiler (`tsc`) is used alongside `tsup` to generate declaration files (`.d.ts`).
- **ES Module Support**: The dual-format build ensures packages can be consumed in both modern and legacy JavaScript environments.
- **Optimized Output**: Builds are configured for optimal tree-shaking and performance.

Each package contains its own `tsup.config.ts` and the `build` script in its `package.json` orchestrates the two-stage build process. This ensures consistency and reliability across the monorepo.

### Adapter Pattern Enforcement

To maintain the integrity of the adapter pattern, this project includes:

- **Custom ESLint Rule**: Enforces that adapter implementations only include methods defined in the `ContractAdapter` interface
- **Automated Validation**: The `lint:adapters` command automatically discovers and validates all adapter implementations
- **CI Integration**: Adapter pattern compliance is checked on every pull request
- **Pre-Push Hook**: Prevents pushing code that violates the adapter pattern

These enforcement mechanisms ensure that the adapter interface remains the single source of truth for adapter implementations, preventing interface drift and maintaining architectural consistency.

For more detailed documentation about the adapter pattern, implementation guidelines, and validation rules, see the documentation within the [`packages/types/src/adapters/base.ts`](./packages/types/src/adapters/base.ts) file where the `ContractAdapter` interface is defined.

## Component Architecture

The project follows a structured component architecture centered around app rendering:

### Renderer Components

The renderer package provides the core `TransactionForm` component for rendering transaction forms. It dynamically selects and renders appropriate field components using its `DynamicFormField` component. The actual UI primitives and field component implementations (like `TextField`, `AddressField`, `Button`, `Input`) are sourced from the `@openzeppelin/ui-builder-ui` package.

These field components are designed to work exclusively with React Hook Form and are orchestrated by `DynamicFormField`.

### Storybook Integration

The project uses Storybook 8 for component documentation and development:

```bash
# Start Storybook at the root level
pnpm storybook

# Or start Storybook for a specific package
pnpm --filter=@openzeppelin/ui-builder-renderer storybook
```

Storybook stories are organized to:

- Document component usage and API
- Showcase different component states and variations
- Provide interactive examples for development
- Serve as visual regression tests

Stories are located in the `stories` directory of each package, with renderer components having the most comprehensive documentation.

## Code Style

### Git Hooks

This project uses Husky to enforce code quality using Git hooks:

- **pre-commit**: Runs lint-staged to format and lint staged files (Prettier first, then ESLint)
- **pre-push**: Runs comprehensive linting and formatting before pushing to remote
- **commit-msg**: Enforces conventional commit message format

These hooks ensure that code pushed to the repository maintains consistent quality and style.

### CSS Class Name Sorting

For consistent CSS class name sorting in Tailwind CSS, always run Prettier first, then ESLint:

```bash
# Recommended approach (runs formatting, then linting)
pnpm fix-all
```

This approach ensures that Tailwind CSS classes are consistently sorted by the prettier-plugin-tailwindcss plugin and prevents conflicts between formatting and linting tools.

### Shared Prettier Configuration

This project uses a single, shared Prettier configuration at the root of the monorepo. Individual packages **should not** include their own `.prettierrc` files. The root configuration includes:

- Common code style settings (single quotes, semi-colons, etc.)
- Tailwind CSS class sorting via prettier-plugin-tailwindcss
- Configuration for special utility functions like `cva`, `cn`, `clsx`, and `twMerge`

To format all packages:

```bash
pnpm format
```

### Import Sorting

Imports are automatically sorted in the following order:

1. React and related packages
2. External packages
3. Internal packages (alias imports starting with `@/`)
4. Parent imports (starting with `..`)
5. Other relative imports (starting with `.`)
6. Style imports
7. Type imports

This ordering is enforced by ESLint and automatically fixed on commit.

## Dependency Management

This project uses several tools to manage dependencies effectively:

- **pnpm**: Fast, disk space efficient package manager
- **check-deps script**: Custom utility to identify deprecated dependencies
- **update-deps script**: Easily update all dependencies to their latest versions
- **Dependencies workflow**: Regular checks for outdated dependencies
- **Update Dependencies workflow**: Weekly automated updates

### Exported Package Versions

The versions of internal `@openzeppelin/` packages used in exported forms are centrally managed in the `packages/builder/src/export/versions.ts` file. This ensures that all exported projects use stable, tested, and reproducible dependency versions.

To update these versions to the latest published releases, run the following command from the root of the monorepo:

```bash
pnpm update-export-versions
```

This script will fetch the latest versions from the npm registry and update the `versions.ts` file automatically.

### Checking for Outdated Dependencies

To see which dependencies are outdated:

```bash
pnpm outdated
```

### Updating Dependencies

For regular updates (respecting semver):

```bash
pnpm update-deps
```

For major version updates (may include breaking changes):

```bash
pnpm update-deps:major
```

### Automated Updates

The project is configured with:

1. **Update Dependencies workflow**: Runs weekly to check for and apply updates

## Adding New Adapters

To add support for a new blockchain ecosystem:

1. **Create Package**: Create a new directory `packages/adapter-<chain-name>` (e.g., `packages/adapter-sui`).
2. **Define `package.json`**:
   - Set the package name (e.g., `@openzeppelin/ui-builder-adapter-sui`).
   - Add a dependency on `@openzeppelin/ui-builder-types` (`workspace:*`).
   - Add any chain-specific SDKs or libraries required by the adapter.
   - Include standard build scripts (refer to existing adapter packages).
   - **Important**: Ensure your package exports a named array of its `NetworkConfig[]` objects (e.g., `export const suiNetworks = [...]`) and its main `Adapter` class from its entry point (`src/index.ts`).
3. **Define `tsconfig.json`**: Create a `tsconfig.json` extending the root `tsconfig.base.json`.
4. **Implement Adapter**:
   - Create `src/adapter.ts`.
   - Import `ContractAdapter`, the specific `YourEcosystemNetworkConfig` (e.g., `SuiNetworkConfig`), and related types from `@openzeppelin/ui-builder-types`.
   - Implement the `ContractAdapter` interface. The constructor **must** accept its specific `NetworkConfig` (e.g., `constructor(networkConfig: SuiNetworkConfig)`).
   - Implement methods to use `this.networkConfig` internally for network-specific operations (e.g., initializing HTTP clients with RPC URLs from the config).
5. **Define Network Configurations**:\
   - Create `src/networks/mainnet.ts`, `testnet.ts`, etc., defining `YourEcosystemNetworkConfig` objects for each supported network.
   - Each network config must provide all necessary details for the adapter to function, such as RPC endpoints (`rpcUrl` or `rpcEndpoint`), chain identifiers (`chainId` for EVM), explorer URLs, native currency details, etc., as defined by its `YourEcosystemNetworkConfig` interface.
   - Create `src/networks/index.ts` to export the combined list of networks (e.g., `export const suiNetworks = [...mainnetSuiNetworks, ...testnetSuiNetworks];`) and also export each network configuration individually by its constant name (e.g., `export { suiMainnet, suiTestnet } from './mainnet';`).
6. **Export Adapter & Networks**: Create `src/index.ts` in your adapter package and export the adapter class (e.g., `export { SuiAdapter } from './adapter';`) and the main networks array (e.g., `export { suiNetworks } from './networks';`). It's also good practice to re-export individual network configurations from the adapter's main entry point if they might be directly imported by consumers.
7. **Register Ecosystem in Builder**:
   - Open `packages/builder/src/core/ecosystemManager.ts`.
   - Import the new adapter class (e.g., `import { SuiAdapter } from '@openzeppelin/ui-builder-adapter-sui';`).
   - Add a new entry to the `ecosystemRegistry` object. This entry defines:
     - `networksExportName`: The string name of the exported network list (e.g., 'suiNetworks'). This is used by the `EcosystemManager` to dynamically load all network configurations for an ecosystem.
     - `AdapterClass`: The constructor of your adapter (e.g., `SuiAdapter as AnyAdapterConstructor`).
   - Add a case for your new ecosystem in the `switch` statement within `loadAdapterPackageModule` to enable dynamic import of your adapter package module (which should export the `AdapterClass` and the `networksExportName` list).
   - Note: If the adapter requires specific package dependencies for _exported projects_ (beyond its own runtime dependencies), these are typically managed by the `PackageManager` configuration within the adapter package itself (e.g., an `adapter.config.ts` file exporting dependency details).
8. **Workspace**: Ensure the new package is included in the `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (if not covered by `packages/*`).
9. **Build & Test**:
   - Build the new adapter package (`pnpm --filter @openzeppelin/ui-builder-adapter-<chain-name> build`).
   - Add relevant unit/integration tests.
   - Ensure the builder application (`pnpm --filter @openzeppelin/ui-builder-app build`) and the export system still function correctly.

## CI/CD Pipeline

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and delivery:

- **CI Workflow**: Runs tests, linting, and type checking for all packages
- **Coverage Workflow**: Generates and uploads test coverage reports
- **Release Workflow**: Manages versioning and releases using Changesets
- **Renderer Publish Workflow**: Builds and tests the renderer package automatically when changes are merged to main
- **Security Workflow**: Checks for security vulnerabilities
- **Dependencies Workflow**: Checks for outdated dependencies
- **Update Dependencies Workflow**: Automatically updates dependencies

### Package Publishing

The project uses [Changesets](https://github.com/changesets/changesets) for managing package versions and releases. All public packages in the monorepo are published to the npm registry.

The publishing process:

1. Developers create changesets for their changes using `pnpm changeset`
2. Changesets are committed alongside the code changes
3. When changes are pushed to the main branch, the GitHub Action:
   - Creates a "Version Packages" PR that aggregates all changesets
   - Updates package versions according to the changesets
   - Updates changelogs for affected packages
4. When the Version Packages PR is merged:
   - Packages are automatically published to npm
   - Git tags are created for each published package version
   - GitHub releases are created with changelogs

To create a changeset for your changes:

```bash
pnpm changeset
```

This will prompt you to:

- Select which packages have changed
- Specify the type of change (major, minor, patch)
- Provide a description of the changes for the changelog

## Monorepo Configuration

This project uses a centralized configuration approach to maintain consistency across all packages:

### Shared Configurations

- **tailwind.config.cjs**: Root configuration for Tailwind CSS, used by all packages
- **postcss.config.cjs**: Root configuration for PostCSS, used by all packages
- **components.json**: Root configuration for shadcn/ui components, referenced by packages

Packages consume these root configs via:

- JS proxy files (`packages/*/tailwind.config.cjs` and `packages/*/postcss.config.cjs`) that require the root configs
- Per-package `components.json` files (regular JSON) that reference the package CSS entry (e.g., `../styles/global.css`)

During the export process, proxy configs and JSON are included to create standalone configuration files for the exported project.

## Runtime Configuration

Both the main UI Builder application and its exported forms support runtime configuration for certain parameters. This is primarily managed via an `AppConfigService` and allows customization without rebuilding the application code.

### Builder Application Configuration (Development)

During development of the builder application, configurations are typically provided via Vite environment variables defined in `.env` files (e.g., `.env.local`). These variables usually follow a prefix like `VITE_APP_CFG_...`.

Key configurable items include:

- **Explorer API Keys:** For services like Etherscan, PolygonScan, etc., used by adapters to fetch ABIs. Example: `VITE_APP_CFG_API_KEY_ETHERSCAN_MAINNET="your_key"`.
- **WalletConnect Project ID:** For EVM adapter's WalletConnect functionality. Example: `VITE_APP_CFG_SERVICE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID="your_id"`.
- **RPC URL Overrides:** To use custom RPC endpoints instead of public defaults for specific networks. Example: `VITE_APP_CFG_RPC_ENDPOINT_ETHEREUM_MAINNET="https://your_custom_rpc.com"`.

### Exported Application Configuration

Exported forms include a `public/app.config.json` file. Users of the exported form should edit this file to provide their own API keys and RPC URLs.

The structure of this JSON file includes sections for:

- `networkServiceConfigs`: For explorer API keys, keyed by a service identifier (e.g., `"etherscan-mainnet"`).
- `globalServiceConfigs`: For global service parameters (e.g., `walletconnect.projectId`).
- `rpcEndpoints`: For RPC URL overrides, keyed by the network ID (e.g., `"ethereum-mainnet"`).

Refer to the README included with the exported application for detailed instructions on configuring `public/app.config.json`.

<!-- Adapter-specific guides are documented in their respective package READMEs. -->
