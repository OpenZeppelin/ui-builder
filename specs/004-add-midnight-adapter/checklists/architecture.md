# Architecture Requirements Quality Checklist: Chain‑Agnostic & Adapter‑Driven

**Purpose**: Validate that requirements enforce chain‑agnostic core and adapter‑driven boundaries
**Created**: 2025-10-12
**Feature**: ./../spec.md

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] CHK001 Are core packages explicitly stated to remain chain‑agnostic with no Midnight deps? [Completeness, Plan §Constitution Check]
- [x] CHK002 Are all adapter responsibilities enumerated (wallet, ingestion, mapping, transaction, diagnostics)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001–FR-016]
- [x] CHK003 Do export requirements list all adapter runtime deps (incl. @midnight-ntwrk/dapp-connector-api)? [Completeness, Spec §FR-015, Export Manifest]

## Requirement Clarity

- [x] CHK004 Is “wallet‑only v1” execution clearly defined and exclusions listed? [Clarity, Spec §FR-011; Non‑Goals]
- [x] CHK005 Are contract inputs unambiguously defined with required/optional flags? [Clarity, Spec §FR-012]

## Requirement Consistency

- [x] CHK007 Do plan, adapter integration, and spec align on view capability (parameter‑less auto views only)? [Consistency, Spec §User Story 3]
- [x] CHK008 Do execution method requirements match adapter integration (no relayer/multisig in v1)? [Consistency, Spec §FR-011, Adapter Integration]
- [x] CHK009 Do export manifest and adapter config dependencies match each other? [Consistency, Export Manifest, Adapter Config]

## Acceptance Criteria Quality

- [x] CHK010 Are success criteria measurable and technology‑agnostic (timings, rates)? [Acceptance, Spec §Success Criteria]
- [x] CHK011 Do success criteria cover export app functioning equivalently to Builder? [Acceptance, Spec §User Story 4, §FR-015]

## Scenario Coverage

- [x] CHK012 Are primary flows defined for wallet connect, ingestion, auto views, write execute, export? [Coverage, Spec §User Stories]
- [x] CHK013 Are exception flows covered (wallet cancel/lock, invalid inputs, submission reject)? [Coverage, Spec §Acceptance]

## Edge Case Coverage

- [x] CHK014 Are boundary cases listed (no explorer, indexing delays, missing deps in exports)? [Edge Case, Spec §Edge Cases]
- [x] CHK015 Are network diagnostics behaviors specified (success/failure, latency)? [Edge Case, Spec §User Story 5]

## Non‑Functional Requirements

- [x] CHK016 Are architectural boundaries (no chain code in core) enforced as non‑negotiable? [NFR, Plan §Constitution Check]
- [x] CHK017 Are design system and storage usage requirements documented? [NFR, Plan §Technical Context]

## Dependencies & Assumptions

- [x] CHK018 Are dependencies and assumptions listed (ecosystem registration, wallet capabilities)? [Dependencies, Spec §Dependencies & Assumptions]

## Ambiguities & Conflicts

- [x] CHK019 Are any adapter methods marked placeholder documented with rationale and phase plan? [Ambiguity, Adapter Integration]
- [x] CHK020 If adapter config deviates from export manifest, is resolution path defined? [Conflict, Export Manifest vs Adapter Config]
